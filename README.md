### Rules of the Game

Pig is a two-player game where the players take turns to roll a six-sided die:

- On each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they want. The sum of the rolls is added to their current score.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current turn ends, and they lose all points gained in that turn. It becomes the other player's turn.
- The player can choose to "hold," which means their turn ends, and their current score gets added to their total score.
- The first player to reach a specified score of 20 wins the game.
